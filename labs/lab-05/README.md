In this lab, we covered the creating of a dodger game using great software development techniques; from developing a basic MVP to a feature rich game.
I added by myself extra features like destroying enemy and bullets that are past the screen's boundaries, so that the game doesn't lag.
Also, made that enemy bullets can be destroyed if they collide with the player bullets.
Extra points are received whenever an enemy is killed or an enemy bullet is destroyed.
